# Ganja
A simple but scalable FFA Practice Core featuring one Game Mode (NoDebuff) & Vasar PvP aspects Made By Wqrro And Updated To PM5 By DidntPot (Jack).

The purpose of this Core is to provide the community with a decent template for making a pot server. There are little to no good examples let alone any at all. It has most of Vasar's PvP aspects, back from before it closed. Everything is hard-coded to promote actual use and change of the Core so there's some variety in the community.

**Requirements:**

1. Download the DEVirion Plugin and place it in your `plugins` folder: [DEVirion by poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/DEVirion/1.2.8)
